    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fish and chips is a traditional British dish consisting of fried 
        fish and thinly sliced fried potatoes. The potatoes are called 
        "French fries" in the U.S. and "chips" in the U.K. </p>
    <p>Many food historians think the first fish and chips shop 
        was opened by Joseph Malin, a young Jewish immigrant, 
        in London in the 1860s. His shop was so popular, 
        it remained open until the 1970s.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds cod fillets</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with 
            cold water.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together 
            in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; 
            stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet 
            to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Drain and pat dry potatoes. Fry in hot oil until tender, 
            about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, 
            and place in hot oil. Fry fish in batches until 
            golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. 
            Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as 
            needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry potatoes again in hot oil until crisp, 
            1 to 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
